Predicting Rain using Rain in Australia dataset with Python-Scikit learn

An approach to build a model which will predict if it will rain tomorrow or not. It is a classification problem. 
The model will gives us 2 classes - either YES or NO. Various classifiers are implemented to find the best model for the data.
The contribution includes the use of class weights in order to counter the problem of class imbalance in the provided dataset.
Model's Recall has been increased by 18%.
